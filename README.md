# Superstore Sales and Profit Analysis

# Project Objective and Introduction

In this project, I analyzed the performance of a retail store in terms of its sales and profits to identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to optimize its operations, pricing, marketing, and inventory management strategies to drive revenue and growth.


# Importing Essential Python Libraries and Datasets

In this section, I've imported essential Python libraries such as Pandas and Plotly and the dataset, laying the foundation for my analysis.

# Data Source

The dataset is a Superstore data from Keggle and contains information such as products, regions, categories, customers, segments, and more.

# Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Pre-Processing 

In order to comprehend the dataset Iâ€™m handling, I engage in data exploration and pre-processing. 
 
This involves:

1.	Descriptive statistics of the dataset.
2.	Additions of new columns to the dataset such as order month, order year, and order day.

# Data Analysis and Visualization

In this section, I performed the following;

1.	Analyzing the monthly sales over the order months.
2.	Analyzing the sales by category.
3.	Analyzing the sales by sub-category.
4.	Analyzing the monthly profits.
5.	Analyzing the profit by category.
6.	Analyzing the profit by sub-category.
7.	Analyzing the sales and profit analysis by customer segments.

# Insight and Recommendations

From the analysis above I was able to draw the following insight from the Superstore dataset

1.	Throughout the year, monthly sales show a steady increase.
2.	The Technology category leads in sales, accounting for 36.4% of total sales, followed closely by Furniture at 32.3% and Office Supplies at 31.3%.
3.	In terms of profitability, the Technology category stands out, contributing 50.8% to the overall profit, while Office Supplies follow at 42.8%, and Furniture trails at 6.44%.
4.	Consumer product sales yield higher profits for the store, yet corporate product sales exhibit a better sales-to-profit ratio.
